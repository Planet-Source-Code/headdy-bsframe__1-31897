## bsFrame

### Description

It's been a long time, but I am back with a new ActiveX control. Presenting the bsFrame control, standing at around 192kb, which is intended as a more dynamic replacement for Microsoft's intrinsic Frame control.

It is in its most basic state at the moment, with support for enabled/disabled states, 3 different frame designs and all 8 possible border styles, as well as customisable colours. In the future there may be support for icons, caption alignment and caption positioning.

Also note that BadSoft Online is back up, please visit my site at http://www.badsoft.co.uk.

If you can, please leave feedback, your comments and constructive criticism. Votes would be good too.
